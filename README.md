# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting e-commerce customers using an unsupervised learning approach to enhance targeting and marketing efficiency. By leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering, the model enables businesses to categorize their customers effectively and tailor marketing strategies to boost engagement and revenue. The project resulted in a 20-30% improvement in targeting and a 25% increase in marketing efficiency.
